Description: miR2Meth is a R package to obtain DNA methylaiton for miRNA promoters 
          by using The Illumina Infinium Methylation BeadChips of 450k, EPIC or 
          EPICv2. It maps the probes of the assays to miRNA promoters to calculate
          methylation level for individual miRNA. This package also provides the 
          functions to identify the differentially methylated miRNA promoters, etc.
